### HAPPY ADVENTURE

Built in Godot 3.5

This game was made as a companion demo to [this](http-x) blog post. A companion video can be found [here](http-x).

*Happy Adventure* is a simple game meant to demonstrate some important concepts in Godot that beginners often struggle with.

Focus is on the following concepts:
- Setting up a readable file structure, and following Godot's style guide
- How to divide things into scenes
- How to structure and access nodes in a scene
- Inheritance and duplicating scenes
- "Changing scenes" (They're really just nodes)
- Using signals and groups to keep things decoupled
- Some cool animation player tricks
